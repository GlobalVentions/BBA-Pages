                                at such factors. • Your lifespan • Your present spending habit • Your present saving
                                habit • Your plan for retirement So, here are the steps that you need to follow to
                                figure out the amount that you will need for a happy retirement.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-regular-14-19 mb-4 text-primary-black max-width-575">Do not ignore the
                                rule of thumb for retirement saving Many people chose to ignore the rule of thumb
                                advised by financial experts.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-regular-14-19 mb-4 text-primary-black max-width-575">You can figure out,
                                how much you need to put in your retirement saving account on a monthly basis.
                                Take the help of a fair retirement calculator Have a correct estimation of your
                                retirement saving amount.
                                Start in your 30s, and keep aside 15-25% of your pretax income to enjoy a significant
                                saving for retirement.
                                Factors on which retirement saving amount depends Since retirement is inevitable but
                                will happen after several years; there are a lot of factors that influence the same.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-regular-14-19 mb-4 text-primary-black max-width-575">Nobody knows what
                                amount he or she must have in the retirement saving account.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph-regular-14-19 mb-4 text-primary-black max-width-575">It is also not true
                                that these rules are not very effective as there is no one-fit-to-all solution, but yes
                                they are indeed better than doing nothing for a retirement saving account.</p>
